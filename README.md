I am a technologist, writing code since 2020. I don't prefer taking gigantic courses on something before starting to work on something. I just simply begin, and figure out my way. *First make it work, then make it better.*

I love working on complicated things. Things that challenge my engineering capabilities. I always worked on things that felt hard enough for me, and I will continue to do so. 

I am a strong believer of Luna Lovegood's quote, *Wit beyond measure, is a man's greatest treasure.* I always prioritize my strategic abilities and thinking capabilities above anything else. After all, I am trying to be in business and wealth development ;). 

I always learning new things. Well, not by attending school, of course. I just love to work on things that I don't know anything about, break stuffs, but at the end, figure it all out. After all, that's how learning should be, isn't it?

If you feel like I am an interesting character, then you shall knock me on my socials. I love connecting with people who thinks I am interesting.
