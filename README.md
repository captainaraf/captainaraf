Efficiency first, and the biggest form of efficiency is removing the ineffective.

I like working on hard problems that push my engineering limits. I deliberately choose projects that feel uncomfortable and complex, because that’s where real progress happens. Right now, I’m building **PippaQuiz** to rethink how knowledge is assessed, helping educators save time, focus on teaching, and deliver meaningful learning experiences with AI.
