I like working on hard problems that push my engineering limits. I deliberately choose projects that feel uncomfortable and complex, because that’s where real progress happens. Right now, I’m building PippaQuiz, a product by Dead Mans Tech, to rethink how knowledge is assessed by helping educators create, run, and automatically evaluate exams with AI. https://www.pippaquiz.com/
