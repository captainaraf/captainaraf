I am a technologist, writing code since 2020. I don't prefer taking gigantic courses on something before starting to work on something. I just simply begin, and figure out my way. *First make it work, then make it better.*

I love working on complicated things. Things that challenge my engineering capabilities. I always worked on things that felt hard enough for me, and I will continue to do so.

# Field of Interest
- Operating Systems, Embedded Systems, Low Level Programming
- Software Architecture, Serverside Programming
- Electronics, Robotics, Mechatronics
- UX Design
- Infrastructure Development, Algorithm Development
- Physics (Speically Electromagnetism, Nuclear Physics)
- Business and Wealth Building
- AI and ML
- Reading Books
- And so on..... (The list acutally never ends, these are just the top priority ones).

If you feel like I am an interesting character, then you shall knock me on my socials. I love connecting with people who thinks I am interesting.
